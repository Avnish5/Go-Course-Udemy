## Introduction

This project is a personal practice repository for applying the Go programming concepts Iâ€™ve learned through [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-guide). It serves as a hands-on exploration of various features in Go, including concurrency, goroutines, and channels. Through this project, I aim to reinforce my understanding of Go and build practical applications that demonstrate my growing skills in software development.
